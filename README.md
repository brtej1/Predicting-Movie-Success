# Predicting-Movie-Success


**Problem Statement**

A major film studio aims to predict the success of its upcoming movies based on IMDb scores, with the goal of categorizing them as either a "Hit," "Average," or "Flop." This prediction will be made by analyzing various movie attributes using advanced data analysis techniques and machine learning. The studio seeks to optimize its production decisions, enhance marketing strategies, and gain insights into factors that influence movie success. The machine learning model will analyze IMDb score patterns and other movie characteristics to improve the studio's understanding of the elements that lead to a movie's commercial and critical success
